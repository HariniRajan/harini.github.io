<h1>American Psycho</h1>

*American Psycho by* Bret Easton Ellis horrified me. I bought this book because the back cover mentioned that it delved into Dostoyevskian themes. I read Crime and Punishment and while I find it such a great book to read, I often struggled with the language (since it was written initially in Russian and the translation to English). I thought this book would be a great fit since I imagined it would be a modern-day Crime and Punishment. 
<br></br>
If I were to describe this book to someone who has read Crime and Punishment, I would say it answers the question "What if Rodion Raskolnikov killed with no empathy?" You can still hear the entire mental narrative of the killer just like Crime and Punishment, however, the main character is a successful wall street banker who is overly concerned with status symbols and murders people as a hobby. As Rubin writes in [this wonderful analysis](https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/511-american-psycho-put-patrick-bateman-under-a-micros/) of the book, "For Bateman, life isn’t a dialogue, it’s a monologue."
<br></br>
The graphic torture of women depicted in the book disgusted me. I would absolutely not recommend it. It made the world feel like a less safe place and I had to watch a couple of hours of wholesome TV to get myself to stop thinking about all the potential Batemans in the world. 
<br></br>
I understand that it could be ironic, but there is no analysis of the violence - just violence against women and men. The descriptions of the violent acts were so lengthy and detailed. It seemed unnecessary, however, it definitely scared me (if that was Ellis's goal, he succeeded) and made me search up analysis pieces of the book to understand the need to include such awful torture of women. It made me think about if it was harder to accept this awful behavior from someone who would be considered the ideal young ambitious American at first glance. The juxtaposition of his lack of morals and the fullness of his social and professional life leads us to question if his social and professional life is truly full. However, we are not given the tools to really wonder about this because we do not have access to Bateman's past. We just know that he gets no pleasure from anything other than proving his superiority in social and professional status and seeing pain in the eyes of others, especially at their helplessness in his hands. 
<br></br>
I enjoyed Crime and Punishment because you could see yourself as Roshnikolv. His thoughts could be anyone's thoughts - but Bateman? Bateman is a man who kills with no pity or regret. He is proud of each murder and hates the people around him. He has no need to kill. It's for pleasure. He is xenophobic and gets angry when people don't treat him the way he thinks he should be treated because he is rich.
<br></br>
My main takeaway from this book is to make sure that my life is a dialogue, a life of pure monologue devoid of empathy makes for quite a boring read.

"As usual, Evelyn misses the essence of what Im saying and I wonder how long it will take to finally get rid of her...She looks back at me and I think that maybe someone is actually comprehending what I'm trying to get through to them, but then she says, 'Let's just avoid the issue, all right? I'm sorry I said anything...'"

- This is a conversation Patrick Bateman has with his fiancee. It points to how the issue in the book is not just Patrick Bateman. It is the entire social circle around him. None of them care for genuine [connections](http://connections.it). They keep in touch with each other because they know that it will maintain their social status. Throughout the book, when Bateman feels like no one hears him, I thought it was a block he had that prevented him from understanding their concern. However, this conversation with  Evelyn points to an external problem in the yuppie culture of the 80s that exacerbates his internal issues.
