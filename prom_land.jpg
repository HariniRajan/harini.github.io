Quotes that stuck with me:

"You think you may be ready that you'll do it a more convenient time. But you don't choose the time. The time chooses you. Either you seize what may turn out to be the only chance you have, or you decide you're willing to live with the knowledge that the chance has passed you by"

- Advice Obama got about running for president

"You've tapped into some collective spirit, a thing we all know and wish for - a sense of connection that overrides our differences and replaces them with a giant swell of possibility a- and like all things that matter most - you know the moment is fleeting and that soon the spell witll be broken"
