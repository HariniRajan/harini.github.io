<h1>Ishmael</h1>
what is this about (for future me): This book written by Daniel Quinn follows the Socratic method. A gorilla is able to communicate with an unnamed main character. The gorilla, named Ishmael, asks the main character some questions about the trajectory of humanity that lead the main character to think outside of his culture. It addresses the unlimited population growth of humans that is straining the world.

I think that this book was magical to me because it was so unexpected - I predicted it would be a good read because of the nature of the person who recommended me this book. However, she wisely did not give me enough information about the book. Had I been told the entire book is just a conversation between two people - I would've immediately rejected it, saying that I just don't enjoy continuous dialogue. I prefer lessons through stories. I like descriptions of imagery and travel through literature. 
<br></br>
Had I dismissed it as not for me, I would've missed out on a lot. The dialogue in the book does create a story. It derives the story through careful questions. It tells the story of humanity. The common story we all follow. The main character is purposefully given very few traits that would separate him from us. We just know that he is a human who wants a teacher for life. Isn't that all of us? Other than the difference in gender, I can completely see myself as this main character. Usually, when I read a book, I make an effort to take on the perspective of a character. Here, I feel for some reason that the character has been created to sit in my shoes.

Structure aside, the novel makes a very compelling argument for why we need to examine the footprint that we leave on this planet. Quite often, environmental efforts are framed as service towards the "other" as in helping other species. The premise is that we as humans are smart and will find a way to survive even after other species go extinct and we lose diversity. Ishmael makes us reconcile with the fact that we are heading towards destruction for humans. There is no us without the 'other'.
<br></br>
Takeaways: we're hurting other species. Do not to hunt down your competitors unless they threaten to come into your space. Do not restrict resources to only yourself
<br></br>
Some counterarguments that come to mind. Maybe they will be addressed later in the book:

Currently, I am in the middle of the book, but I wonder if God or whatever power above did not want this to happen, would he have given humans the ability to think and create this much? Would we be stalling innovation by telling humans to stop looking for solutions to famine? If other animals were given the same ability to think and create, would they do the same?
