<h1>Dune</h1>
<p>I chose to read this book because I normally have a tough time following long series such as the Marvel Universe or Star Trek. I always enjoyed the idea of submerging myself in a different world, but it only interested me if it was based on human experiences such as The Hunger Games. I wanted to challenge myself by reading a book based in a completely different environment. When I was younger, I was able to place myself in different environments (such as the Harry Potter world) with relative ease. Today, that is a much tougher task because I feel more distracted. I think that switching contexts is a skill I can work on especially in the future as the ability to understand a world completely different from mine will surely come into use in today's divided landscape.

I did not feel invested in the main character of Paul Atreides. I felt like I was following along with him until the timelapse (after he has a kid with Chani). I think it is the lack of emotion he has. Perhaps this was on purpose as that is how others around him (such as his mother) felt about him. However, going back and reading it. I think it's interesting how he was put in a position to show no emotion at such a young age and he handled it somewhat well(?) He translates his grief into action and protects the people around him.

The character of Alia seems really interesting. The thought of a child being born with all the knowledge of her ancestors is crazy. We spend so much time as children re-learning what our parents had learned when they were children. I must admit that this is time well-spent, and the different processes through which we learn are key to new perspectives. There is something beautiful about the process of learning as well that motivates us to explore and gives us purpose when waking up each morning...With that being said, it would be interesting if we were all born with a basic set of knowledge since humans have developed such a vast body of information about the world around us, and education curriculums around the world are struggling to pass on all this information to children within 12-14 years of school education.  Initially, Chani (Paul's love interest) seemed really cool. She was the woman who bested Paul Atreides in a fight after all! However, she kinda just fades away into the background later and becomes an influence on Paul's actions but we never learn what she feels or thinks. I hope she plays a larger part in future Dune novels.

Themes: Destiny, The need to understand all future pathways, let the emotion go through you and only you will stand but stronger, how appearances/manipulation and stereotypes against a population can influence you against a person whom you would normally trust [shown through Gurney's Halleck's mistrust of Jessica, that is spurred by his opinions on Bene Gesserit women]

The complexity of the world is admirable and reminds me of Harry Potter. A lot of time was well-spent on world-building. Honestly, I'm still unclear on the importance of sandworms in the story.

In Dune, the reader would benefit from attachment to the world instead of attachment to the character, seeing as how there are many characters who are "heroes". Herbert spends a long time getting to any plot as well, so you might as well start enjoying the description of the world. It's the harsh environment of Dune and the dependency on the spice melange that is truly setting the story in motion. The sequels are all connected through the Dune world. Paul Atreides himself does not have much of influence (especially in Children of Dune onwards).

Notable Quotes:
<br></br>
“Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it. But it’s a human trait that when we encounter personal problems, these things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated thing that’s really chewing on us.” - Lady Jessica

"I need time to consider the future that is a past within my mind" -Paul
<br></br>
We as normal people do not have the powers that Paul Atreides has, but we do have the ability to consider many futures. Thinking of the future as one of the pasts within my mind.</p>
